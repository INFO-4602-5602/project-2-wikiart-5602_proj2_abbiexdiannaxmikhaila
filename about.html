      <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
      <p>For this project, we wanted to see if there was a relationship to the information given about the art in the Wiki Art database and events in modern history. We chose to focus on the 20th Century because of the number of events to pull from (including two World Wars and multiple social movements). We compiled a list of 40 events ranging from the Wright Brothers first flight to the attacks on 9/11.</p>
      <p>With the category data, we split it to a main category (the first occurring category) and the subcategory. For simplicity, we chose to look at the main category, which also relates to what art movement it is a part of.</p>
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>We started by choosing three areas we wanted to explore first: art movements, emotional responses, and level of detail of the artwork. What we wanted to see is that if these items related to each other or also to events happening around that time. With building the website, we chose to use Foundation Site styles for ease of use.</p>
      <p>Our first step was creating three charts, each looking at the 20th century and focusing on one of our three main topics. Then we discussed what we found interesting and chose that what would be a good fourth visualization. Since social movements and event seemed to have more of an effect on different elements, we thought about looking specifically at one of the opposing attitudes (pessimism and optimism) would reveal something new or confirm some of our correlations we discussed in the first three visualizations. We chose line charts for three of our visualizations because of the linearity of the timeline. We added some event references as dashed lines or shaded regions for events occuring over a period of years.</p>
      <p>We chose a Gannt representation for the level of detail visualization because we wanted to get an idea of density and if there was a shift in both time or art movement. The bars in the chart allow for the ability to easily see where things are clustered more closely.</p>
      <p>When added our stories, we started with what we found interesting and supplemented the story with a few online resources around the topic of discussion. </p>
      <h2>Caveats of the Data</h2>
      <p>In looking closer at the data, we noticed that a lot of artists whose work we know are tied to events (such as Andy Warhol’s or Norman Rockwell’s art during the Civil Rights Movement were missing from the data). This is a result of the subset of cleaned data from Wiki Art’s full database and the sampling system used for this clean data. We also kept wondering about the demographics of who was rating and choosing emotional responses for the art. Were they mostly from the U.S.? European countries?</p>
      <p>It seems that a lot of the data matches with events in Western World and U.S. History, which leads us to be critical of the representation of this data. Nonetheless, we do think the correlations we saw are interesting and would be interesting to look at using the full Wiki Art dataset.</p>
      <h2>Team Roles</h2>
      <p>All members met together to decide the initial three topics before distributing them for exploration and chose to focus on the 20th century to the number of events to pull from. Mikhaila built the groundwork for the site which presents the visualizations and created the visualization exploring art movements of the 20th century. Abbie worked on the emotional response to the art of the 20th century. Dianna worked on the level of detail (face/body distribution) in art during the 20th century. Together, Abbie and Dianna brainstormed and created a visualization looking at opposing emotions (pessimism and optimism). </p>
