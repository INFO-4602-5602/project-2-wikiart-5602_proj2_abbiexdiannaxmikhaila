            <h4>Different Art Categories’ Usage of Face and Bodies Over Time</h4>
            <p>This gantt (a type of bar) chart shows the usage of face and body images in the selected nine art categories over time. The time around the 1950s seems to be indicative of a shift in what was being portrayed in the art that was being produced, even within the same categories. With Abstract Expressionism, for example, it looks like there was a transition to not including faces or bodies around the 1950s. While many of the categories show a fairly constant usage of both body and face over the course of the timeline (e.g. Expressionism, Neo-Expressionism, Surrealism), this change piques the interest as to why this could have been the case within Abstract Expressionism. The chart also raises questions about the category of ‘Art Informel’ (or Informalism), which hardly had anything at all, and then when it did start occuring around the 1950s, did not portray much body or face. 
</p>
            <p>It turns out that there is a very logical explanation for this that ties the two genres together -- Informalism was actually a pictorial movement from the 1940s to the 1950s which included all the abstract and gestural tendencies that developed in France and the rest of Europe during World War II (which also could be a factor in the increase around 1950 of art pieces in Minimalism that contained neither body nor face.) It was parallel to American abstract Expressionism, which makes perfect sense looking at their patterns of occurrence for neither body nor face, and even more sense when you look at an example of Abstract Expressionism alongside one from Art Informel. This simple chart acts as a lens to understanding the internationalisation that took place in the 1950s that was manifested through the art of the time.
