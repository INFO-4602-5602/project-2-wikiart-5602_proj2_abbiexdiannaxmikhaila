            <h4>Art Movements Throughout the 20th Century.</h4>
            <p>The line chart shows the popular art movements of the 20th century. When thinking about art movements, you might often relate them to main events in history and what the catalysts were. In this line chart, two moments in history stand out: the events leading up to WWII and the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
            <p>Surrealism begins as a movement after WWI and is at its peak right before the start of WWII. At this time, the world is suffering economically, which gives rise to fascist and communist movements. Mussolini comes into power in Italy in 1922 and Hitler comes into power in Germany in 1933. After both of these events, there is a small spike in Surrealism art. </p>
            <p>In relation to the U.S. history, 1929 is the start of the Great Depression with 1933 being the worst year. Both of these points also have spikes in Surrealism. Tensions are building for the second World War and by 1935, the U.S. passed the Neutrality Act of 1935 and declares it unsafe to travel for American citizens in warring nations. This year marks the rise of Surrealism to its peak in 1937. As WWII begins, the movement decreases until a small spike in 1941 (the year of Pearl Harbor) before Abstract Expressionism takes over.</p>
            <p>Abstract Expressionism and Art Informal take over as the main art movements after WWII and during the beginning of the cold war. Reaching their peaks after the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. Around 1961 (year the Berlin Wall was constructed) Pop Art and Minimalism starts to become more popular. Though art around this period had become apolitical due to the censorship of the 1950s and its commercial value, it was also used to as a financial support for the Civil Rights Movement, reinvigorating its political nature.*</p>
            <p>What is also interesting within this period, is that the art movements start to decrease after the Apollo 11 lands on the moon in 1969. This suggests that in addition to the Civil Rights Movement, Cold War tensions leading up to the space race were also affecting the art movements during this period of time. What is learned from this chart is that the art movements seem more attuned to social movements and events rather than times of war.</p>
